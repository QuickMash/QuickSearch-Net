# QuickMash Net
A Fast search engine for the web. Open Source and made in PHP. Uses the Custom Google Search API to get results and is fairly easy to customise.
## ABOUT
Based off my earliy search engine QuickSearch(https://quickmash.github.io/search), a solely google.com based search engine, that I have made into a full search engine.
## Future plans
- Planning to make this into a program for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Make customisation even easier by adding a better customizer. Along with CSS.
